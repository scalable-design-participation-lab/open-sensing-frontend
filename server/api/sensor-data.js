/**
 * API endpoint for retrieving aggregated sensor data
 *
 * This endpoint connects to a PostgreSQL database and retrieves aggregated sensor data.
 * The data is grouped into 2-hour intervals and includes average values for various
 * sensor measurements such as temperature, humidity, VOC, NOx, and particulate matter.
 *
 * @async
 * @function
 * @param {Object} event - The H3 event object
 * @returns {Promise<Array>} An array of aggregated sensor data objects
 * @throws {Error} If there's an error executing the database query
 *
 * @example
 * // Response
 * [
 *   {
 *     timestamp: '2023-01-01T00:00:00Z',
 *     temperature: 22.5,
 *     relative_humidity: 45,
 *     voc: 100,
 *     nox: 20,

 *     pm25: 10,
